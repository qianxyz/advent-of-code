# Advent of Code

A minimal and functional Python template, and my solutions,
for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

To start solving, for example, Day 1 of Year 2021, run
```
python aoc.py 2021 1
```
This command downloads the input, creates a solution template
or runs your solution.

You can also create or run your custom test input by adding
the `-t` or `--test` flag.

```
$ python aoc.py -h

positional arguments:
  year        allowed values from 2015 to 2029
  day         allowed values from 1 to 25

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -t, --test  use test input
```
